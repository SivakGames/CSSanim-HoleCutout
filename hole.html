			<p>Mainly posted for my own reference, but there was a time when I was searching for how to do a kind of inverse clip path.
				Instead of having the circle remain and discard all the content around it, I wanted the opposite:  Cut out a hole out in the center and
				leave the surrounding content. Ultimately, I wanted to do a kind of circular opening animation.</p>
			<p>It turns out, the only CSS needed is simply: </p>
			<code>mask: <em>radial-gradient</em>(circle <var>XXXpx</var>, transparent <var>100%</var>, #FFF <var>100%</var>);</code>
			<p>where XXX is the size of the circle.  If you want some blur along the circle's edge, change the transparent part's percentage to a lower one.</p>
			<p>Anyway, I just slapped this simple demo together to show how to cut out a hole in content.
				The above content has the ID simply entitled "the-hole" and anything within will get cut out of the circle.</p>
